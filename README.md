# AmazonDRS #

This library allows your agent code to work with the [Amazon Dash Replenishment Service](https://developer.amazon.com/dash-replenishment-service) via the [RESTful API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/replenish-endpoint.html).

This version of the library supports the following functionality:

- Two methods of device authentication on the Dash Replenishment Service: [internal and external authentication](#authentication)
- Placing test orders for Amazon goods
- Canceling test orders
- Placing real orders for Amazon goods

**To add this library to your project, add the following lines to the top of your agent code:**

```squirrel
// Rocky is only required if you are going to use the internal authentication
#require "Rocky.class.nut:2.0.1"
#require "AmazonDRS.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"
```

## Library Usage ##

### Prerequisites ###

Before using the library you need to have:

- An Amazon Developer account
- [Client ID and Secret of your LWA Security Profile](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/create-a-security-profile.html)
- [A DRS device](https://developer.amazon.com/dash-replenishment/drs_console.html)

### Authentication ###

There are two authentication methods available in this library:
- [Internal authentication](#internal-authentication)
- [External authentication](#external-authentication)

#### Internal authentication ####

This method allows you to authenticate an agent as a DRS-device in the Amazon's Login With Amazon (LWA) without writing any extra code. But it may be not appropriate for production usage due to necessity of exposing the agent's URL.

The authentication flow is the following:
1. a user opens the agent's URL in a browser
1. the library handles this request and redirects the user to the Amazon login page or to the Amazon device's settings page if the user is already logged in
1. the user sets up the device in the Amazon's UI
1. the Amazon's LWA redirects the user back to the agent's URL with an authorization code
1. the agent receives this code and acquires security tokens (`Refresh Token` and `Access Token`)

#### External authentication ####

This options is used when a `Refresh Token` is acquired by an external code and should be passed to this library, so that the library can get and refresh an `Access Token`. This approach may be used in production, for example, with some intermediary server which manages authentication process.

### Callbacks ###

All requests that are made to the Amazon platform occur asynchronously. Every method that sends a request has an optional parameter which takes a callback function that will be executed when the operation is completed, whether successfully or not. The callbackâ€™s parameters are listed in the corresponding method description, but every callback has at least one parameter, *error*. If *error* is `0`, the operation has been executed successfully. Otherwise, *error* is a code of an error.

## AmazonDRS Class ##

### Constructor: AmazonDRS(*deviceModel, deviceSerial, clientId, clientSecret*) ###

This method returns a new AmazonDRS instance.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| *deviceSerial* | String | Yes | `Device Serial`. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/lwa-web-api.html#integrate-with-the-lwa-sdk-for-javascript). |
| *clientId* | String | Yes | `Client ID` of your LWA Security Profile. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/glossary.html#client_identifier). |
| *clientSecret* | String | Yes | `Client Secret` of your LWA Security Profile. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/glossary.html#client_secret). |

#### Example ####

```
#require "AmazonDRS.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"
TODO
```

### startAuthentication(*[onAuthenticated[, testDevice]]*) ###

This method starts the [internal authentication](#internal-authentication). Either this method or [*setRefreshToken*](TODO) should be called and authentication should be done before making any DRS-related requests.

Successful authentication automatically disables the internal authentication started with this method. You may call this method to start the internal authentication again.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *onAuthenticated* | Function | Optional | Callback called when the operation is completed or an error happens. |
| *testDevice* | Boolean | Optional | `True` if it is a test device making test orders. `False` by default. For more information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/test-device-purchases.html). |

The method returns nothing. A result of the operation may be obtained via the [onAuthenticated](TODO) callback, if specified in this method.

#### Callback: onAuthenticated(*error, details*) ####

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | Integer | `0` if the authentication is successful, an error code otherwise. |
| *details* | Table | Key-value table with the error's details provided by Amazon server. May be empty. This parameter should be ignored if *error* is `0`. [See "Error Parameters" for more information](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html#authorization-errors). |

TODO: could be some exceptions

#### Example ####

```
TODO
```

### setRefreshToken(*refreshToken*) ###

This method allows to set a `Refresh Token` manually. It is used for the [external authentication](#external-authentication). Either this method or [*startAuthentication*](TODO) should be called before making any DRS-related requests.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *refreshToken* | String | Yes | An authentication `Refresh Token` used to acquire an `Access Token` and refresh it when expired. |

The method returns nothing.

#### Example ####

```
TODO
```

### replenish(*slotId[, onReplenished]*) ###

This method places an order for a device/slot combination. For more information, please see [the Amazon DRS documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/replenish-endpoint.html).

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *slotId* | String | Yes | ID of a slot to place an order for it. |
| *onReplenished* | Function | Optional | Callback called when the operation is completed or an error happens. |

The method returns nothing. A result of the operation may be obtained via the [onReplenished](TODO) callback, if specified in this method.

#### Callback: onReplenished(*error, response*) ####

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | Integer | `0` if the operation is completed successfully, an error code otherwise. |

### cancelTestOrder(*[slotId[, onCanceled]]*) ###

This method cancels test orders for one or all slots in the device. For more information, please see [the Amazon DRS documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/canceltestorder-endpoint.html).

The method can only be used for the orders made by a test device ([a device authenticated as a test one](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/test-device-purchases.html)). The library does not check if your device authenticated as a test one or not, so you are responsible for this check.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *slotId* | String | Yes | ID of a slot to be canceled. If is `null` or not specified test orders for all slots in the device will be canceled. |
| *onCanceled* | Function | Optional | Callback called when the operation is completed or an error happens. |

The method returns nothing. A result of the operation may be obtained via the [onCanceled](TODO) callback, if specified in this method.

#### Callback: onCanceled(*error, response*) ####

| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | Integer | `0` if the operation is completed successfully, an error code otherwise. |
| *response* | Table | Key-value table with the response provided by Amazon server. May be empty. [See response example](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/canceltestorder-endpoint.html#response-example). |

#### Example ####

```
TODO
```

### setDebug(*value*) ###

This method enables (*value* is `true`) or disables (*value* is `false`) the library debug output (including error logging). It is disabled by default. The method returns nothing.

### Error codes ###

An *Integer* error code which specifies a concrete error (if any) happened during an operation.
