# AmazonDRS #

This library allows your agent code to work with the [Amazon Dash Replenishment Service](https://developer.amazon.com/dash-replenishment-service) via the [RESTful API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/replenish-endpoint.html).

This version of the library supports the following functionality:

- Device authentication on the Dash Replenishment Service
- Place test orders for Amazon goods
- Cancel test orders
- Place real orders for Amazon goods

TODO: write a description of the auth process used

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "AmazonDRS.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"` **to the top of your agent code**

## Library Usage ##

### Prerequisites ###

Before using the library you need to have:

- An Amazon Developer account
- [Client ID and Secret of your LWA Security Profile](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/create-a-security-profile.html)
- [A DRS device](https://developer.amazon.com/dash-replenishment/drs_console.html)

### Callbacks ###

All requests that are made to the Amazon platform occur asynchronously. Every method that sends a request has an optional parameter which takes a callback function that will be executed when the operation is completed, whether successfully or not. The callbackâ€™s parameters are listed in the corresponding method description, but every callback has at least one parameter, *error*. If *error* is `0`, the operation has been executed successfully. Otherwise, *error* is a code of an error.

Some methods require callbacks to be specified, others need only be passed a callback if you wish.

## AmazonDRS Class ##

### Constructor: AmazonDRS(*clientId, clientSecret[, onAuthenticated[, refreshToken]]*) ###

This method returns a new AmazonDRS instance.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *clientId* | String | Yes | `Client ID` of your LWA Security Profile. |

## ThingWorx.Error Class ##

This class represents an error returned by the library and has the following public properties:

- *type* &mdash; The error type, which is one of the following *THING_WORX_ERROR* enum values:
    - *LIBRARY_ERROR* &mdash; The library is wrongly initialized, a method is called with invalid argument(s), or an internal error has occurred. The error details can be found in the *details* property. Usually this indicates an issue during application development which should be fixed during debugging and therefore should not occur after the application has been deployed.
    - *REQUEST_FAILED* &mdash; An HTTP request to the ThingWorx platform failed. The error details can be found in the *details*, *httpStatus* and *httpResponse* properties. This error may occur during the normal execution of an application. The application logic should process this error.
   - *UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE* &mdash; An unexpected response from the ThingWorx platform. The error details can be found in the *details* and *httpResponse* properties.
- *details* &mdash; A string containing a human readable description of the error.
- *httpStatus* &mdash; An integer indicating the HTTP status code, or `null` if the *type* property is *LIBRARY_ERROR*
- *httpResponse* &mdash; A table of key-value strings holding the response body of the failed request, or `null` if the *type* property is *LIBRARY_ERROR*.
