# AmazonDRS #

This library allows your agent code to work with the [Amazon Dash Replenishment Service](https://developer.amazon.com/dash-replenishment-service) via the [RESTful API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/replenish-endpoint.html).

This version of the library supports the following functionality:

- Device authentication on the Dash Replenishment Service
- Placing test orders for Amazon goods
- Canceling test orders
- Placing real orders for Amazon goods

TODO: should we write a description of the auth process used? Or is it enough to make a link to the example's readme?

**To add this library to your project, add the following lines to the top of your agent code:**

```squirrel
#require "rocky.class.nut:2.0.1" (TODO: Should we place this line into the library's code?)
#require "AmazonDRS.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"
```

## Library Usage ##

### Prerequisites ###

Before using the library you need to have:

- An Amazon Developer account
- [Client ID and Secret of your LWA Security Profile](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/create-a-security-profile.html)
- [A DRS device](https://developer.amazon.com/dash-replenishment/drs_console.html)

### Callbacks ###

All requests that are made to the Amazon platform occur asynchronously. Every method that sends a request has an optional parameter which takes a callback function that will be executed when the operation is completed, whether successfully or not. The callbackâ€™s parameters are listed in the corresponding method description, but every callback has at least one parameter, *error*. If *error* is `0`, the operation has been executed successfully. Otherwise, *error* is a code of an error.

## AmazonDRS Class ##

### Constructor: AmazonDRS(*deviceModel, deviceSerial, clientId, clientSecret*) ###

This method returns a new AmazonDRS instance.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *deviceModel* | String | Yes | `Device Model`. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/lwa-web-api.html#integrate-with-the-lwa-sdk-for-javascript). |
| *deviceSerial* | String | Yes | `Device Serial`. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/lwa-web-api.html#integrate-with-the-lwa-sdk-for-javascript). |
| *clientId* | String | Yes | `Client ID` of your LWA Security Profile. |
| *clientSecret* | String | Yes | `Client Secret` of your LWA Security Profile. |

#### Example ####

```
#require "AmazonDRS.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"
TODO
```

### startAuthentication(*[testDevice[, onAuthenticated]]*) ###

This method starts the authentication process using the internal mechanisms. The authentication process is described [here](TODO). Either this method or [*setRefreshToken*](TODO) should be called and authentication should be done before making any DRS-related requests.

The internal authentication mechanisms become disabled once authentication succeeds. They can be restarted if needed.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *testDevice* | Boolean | Optional | `True` if it is a test device making test orders. For more information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/test-device-purchases.html). |
| *onAuthenticated* | Function | Optional | Callback called when any result of authentication is got. |

The method returns nothing. A result of the operation may be obtained via the [onAuthenticated](TODO) callback, if specified in this method.

#### Callback: onAuthenticated(*error, details*) ####

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | Integer | `0` if the authentication is successful, an error code otherwise. |
| *details* | Table | Key-value table with the error's details provided by Amazon server. May be empty. This parameter should be ignored if *error* is `0`. [More about authentication errors descriptions](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html#authorization-errors). |

TODO: could be some exceptions

#### Example ####

```
TODO
```

### setRefreshToken(*refreshToken*) ###

This method allows to set a `Refresh Token` manually. It is used with an external authentication process handler. Either this method or [*startAuthentication*](TODO) should be called before making any DRS-related requests.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *refreshToken* | String | Yes | An authentication `Refresh Token` used to acquire an `Access Token` and refresh it when expired. |

The method returns nothing.

#### Example ####

```
TODO
```

### replenish(*slotId[, onReplenished]*) ###

This method places an order for a device/slot combination. For more information, please see [the Amazon DRS documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/replenish-endpoint.html).

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *slotId* | String | Yes | ID of a slot to place an order for it. |
| *onReplenished* | Function | Optional | Callback called when the operation is completed or an error happens. |

The method returns nothing. A result of the operation may be obtained via the onReplenished callback, if specified in this method.

#### Callback: onReplenished(*error, response*) ####

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | Integer | `0` if the operation is completed successfully, an error code otherwise. |
| *response* | Table | Key-value table with the response provided by Amazon server. May be empty. |

#### Example ####

```
TODO
```

### cancelTestOrder(*slotId[, onCanceled]*) ###

This method cancels test orders for one or all slots in the device. For more information, please see [the Amazon DRS documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/canceltestorder-endpoint.html).

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *slotId* | String | Yes | ID of a slot to cancel a test order for it. |
| *onReplenished* | Function | Optional | Callback called when the operation is completed or an error happens. |

The method returns nothing. A result of the operation may be obtained via the onCanceled callback, if specified in this method.

#### Callback: onCanceled(*error, response*) ####

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | Integer | `0` if the operation is completed successfully, an error code otherwise. |
| *response* | Table | Key-value table with the response provided by Amazon server. May be empty. |

```

### setDebug(*value*) ###

This method enables (*value* is `true`) or disables (*value* is `false`) the library debug output (including error logging). It is disabled by default. The method returns nothing.

### Error codes ###

An *Integer* error code which specifies a concrete error (if any) happened during an operation.

| 1000 | The client is not authenticated. |
| 1001 | The authentication process is already started. |
