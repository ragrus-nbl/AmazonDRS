# AmazonDRS #

This library allows your agent code to work with the [Amazon Dash Replenishment Service](https://developer.amazon.com/dash-replenishment-service) via the [RESTful API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/replenish-endpoint.html).

This version of the library supports the following functionality:

- Device authentication on the Dash Replenishment Service
- Placing test orders for Amazon goods
- Canceling test orders
- Placing real orders for Amazon goods

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "AmazonDRS.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"` **to the top of your agent code.**

## Library Usage ##

### Prerequisites ###

Before using the library you need to have:

- An Amazon Developer account
- [Client ID and Secret of your LWA Security Profile](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/create-a-security-profile.html)
- [A DRS device](https://developer.amazon.com/dash-replenishment/drs_console.html)

### Authentication ###

This library needs a `Refresh Token` to be able to call the Amazon's DRS API.
The `Refresh Token` can be acquired with the [login()](#logindevicemodel-deviceserial-onauthenticated-testdevice) method. Also, it can be acquired with any other application-specific way and then passed in with the [setRefreshToken()](#setrefreshtokenrefreshtoken) method.

The [login()](#logindevicemodel-deviceserial-onauthenticated-testdevice) method provides the following authentication flow:
1. a user opens the agent's URL in a browser
1. the library handles this request and redirects the user to the Amazon login page or to the Amazon device's settings page if the user is already logged in
1. the user sets up the device in the Amazon's UI
1. the Amazon's LWA redirects the user back to the agent's URL with an authorization code
1. the agent receives this code and acquires security tokens (`Refresh Token` and `Access Token`)

More about authentication [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/lwa-web-api.html) and [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html). Also, see [the provided example](#example-store-and-load-refresh-token).

**Note**: After each restart of the agent the `Refresh Token` should be passed in to the library. So if you don't want to go through the authentication steps again, you may save the token in the agent's persistent storage and set it with the [setRefreshToken()](#setrefreshtokenrefreshtoken) method after each restart of the agent.

### Test Orders ###

For testing purposes, Amazon DRS allows making [test orders](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/test-device-purchases.html). Test orders are those that made by a DRS device authenticated as a test device. So it is determined at the step of authentication whether the device is for testing or not.
Due to this the [login()](#logindevicemodel-deviceserial-onauthenticated-testdevice) method has a parameter *testDevice*. But if you set a `Refresh Token` manually with the [setRefreshToken()](#setrefreshtokenrefreshtoken) method, only you know whether this token was obtained for testing or not and such *testDevice* parameter is not required here.

Only test orders can be canceled with the [cancelTestOrder()](#canceltestorderslotid-oncanceled) method.

### Callbacks ###

All requests that are made to the Amazon platform occur asynchronously. Every method that sends a request has an optional parameter which takes a callback function that will be executed when the operation is completed, whether successfully or not. The callback’s parameters are listed in the corresponding method description, but every callback has at least one parameter, *error*. If *error* is `0`, the operation has been executed successfully. Otherwise, *error* is a code of an error.

## AmazonDRS Class ##

### Constructor: AmazonDRS(*clientId, clientSecret*) ###

This method returns a new AmazonDRS instance.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *clientId* | String | Yes | `Client ID` of your LWA Security Profile. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/glossary.html#client_identifier). |
| *clientSecret* | String | Yes | `Client Secret` of your LWA Security Profile. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/glossary.html#client_secret). |

### login(*deviceModel, deviceSerial[, onAuthenticated[, testDevice]]*) ###

This method allows to authenticate the agent on the Amazon and get required security tokens. The method automatically sets the obtained tokens to be used for DRS API calls, so you do not need to call the [setRefreshToken()](#setrefreshtokenrefreshtoken) method. For more information, please read about [authentication](#authentication). 

Either this method or [setRefreshToken()](#setrefreshtokenrefreshtoken) should be called and authentication should be done before making any DRS-related requests.

**If you are going to use this method, please add** `#require "Rocky.class.nut:2.0.1"` **to the top of your agent code.**

If the **Rocky** library is not included, the method will throw an exception.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *deviceModel* | String | Yes | `Device Model`. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/lwa-web-api.html#integrate-with-the-lwa-sdk-for-javascript). |
| *deviceSerial* | String | Yes | `Device Serial`. For information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/lwa-web-api.html#integrate-with-the-lwa-sdk-for-javascript). |
| *onAuthenticated* | Function | Optional | Callback called when the operation is completed or an error happens. |
| *testDevice* | Boolean | Optional | `True` if it is a test device. `False` by default. For more information, please see [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/dash/test-device-purchases.html) and the [Test Orders section](#test-orders). |

The method returns nothing. A result of the operation may be obtained via the [onAuthenticated](#callback-onauthenticatederror-response) callback if specified in this method.

#### Callback: onAuthenticated(*error, response*) ####

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *error* | Integer | `0` if the authentication is successful, an [error code](#error-code) otherwise. See possible HTTP error codes [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html#access-token-errors). |
| *response* | Table | Key-value table with the response provided by Amazon server. May be `null`. [See here about the response format](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html#access-token-response). Also may contain error details described [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html#access-token-errors) and [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/authorization-code-grant.html#authorization-errors). |

    if (error != 0) {
        server.error("Error canceling: code = " + error + " response = " + http.jsonencode(response));
        return;
    }
    server.log("The order has been canceled. Response from server: " + http.jsonencode(response));
}

// It is supposed that client has been authenticated with either login() method or setRefreshToken() method

client <- AmazonDRS(AMAZON_DRS_CLIENT_ID, AMAZON_DRS_CLIENT_SECRET);

refreshToken = getStoredRefreshToken();
if (refreshToken != null) {
    client.setRefreshToken(refreshToken);
} else {
    function onAuthenticated(error, response) {
        if (error != 0) {
            server.error("Error authenticating: code = " + error + " response = " + http.jsonencode(response));
            return;
        }
        refreshToken = client.getRefreshToken();
        client.setRefreshToken(refreshToken);
        local persist = server.load();
        persist.amazonDRS <- { "refreshToken" : refreshToken };
        server.save(persist);
        server.log("Successfully authenticated!");
        server.log("Refresh Token saved!");
    }
    
    local testDevice = true;
